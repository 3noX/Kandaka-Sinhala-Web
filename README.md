# Kandaka-Sinhala-Web
Kandaka is a bold and creative Sinhala-language website built for educational and personal exploration. Designed with a neon red-on-black aesthetic, it features a modern UI, an image gallery, and Sinhala typography to reflect Sri Lankan culture. This project was developed purely for fun, learning, and portfolio purposes (not for commercial use.)
